## Briefly

With 12 years of professional software development experience I have been working both as an IC (individually and with a team), as well as in a technical leadership position for team of 15 engineers. As an IC, I'm especially good at web development with JavaScript, my tools of choice being React and GraphQL. In a position of leadership, I enjoy collaborating with customers, participating in product development and working with other teams within the company. I excel at identifying improvements to team's or company's processes.

<!-- ## GraphQL Consulting and Training

I'm available for GraphQL, React and React Native remote consulting. My rate is €200/h (\$225/h). I'm available both for full-time and part-time projects of any length; however ideal project for me is 3 to 6 month long and either full-time or 80%.

Examples of projects, where I'd be a great fit, are:

- Designing and implementing the transition of your app to GraphQL
- Designing or reviewing the architecture of your new GraphQL app
- Delivering a critical feature in a time-constrained environment
- Support your organization's use of graphql open source libraries, like `graphql-js` or `graphql-tools`, by fixing bugs or implementing new features

I also offer on-site training within Europe, both for server-side and client-side GraphQL. Training costs €7500 per day of training. -->

This greatly increased focus on the team and more features were shipped in Q2 comparing to Q1 or 2019.
