## Briefly

I'm expert in web technologies. I've been doing programming professionally for 9 years. I'm especially good in doing web in JavaScript, my tools of choice being React and GraphQL. In addition to that, I'm fluent in Python, Clojure and Common Lisp. I'm great at operating independently, including remotely and across different timezones. I'm great at getting things done and I can provide positive impact to any project really fast.
