## Briefly

I've been doing software development professionally for 12 years. I have track record of working both as an IC (both alone and within a team) and in a technical leadership position. As an IC, I'm especially good at web development with JavaScript, my tools of choice being React and GraphQL. In a position of leadership, I enjoy collaborating with customers, participating in product development and working with other teams within the company. I excel at discovering issues with team's or company's processes and finding solutions to them.

<!-- ## GraphQL Consulting and Training

I'm available for GraphQL, React and React Native remote consulting. My rate is €200/h (\$225/h). I'm available both for full-time and part-time projects of any length; however ideal project for me is 3 to 6 month long and either full-time or 80%.

Examples of projects, where I'd be a great fit, are:

- Designing and implementing the transition of your app to GraphQL
- Designing or reviewing the architecture of your new GraphQL app
- Delivering a critical feature in a time-constrained environment
- Support your organization's use of graphql open source libraries, like `graphql-js` or `graphql-tools`, by fixing bugs or implementing new features

I also offer on-site training within Europe, both for server-side and client-side GraphQL. Training costs €7500 per day of training. -->
